## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. To do this, we want to find out the temperature trends using the temperature data for the month of June and December.
## Results
 1. Looking into interquartile range, we would see that in June the range of temperature is from 67F to 83F, whereas in December it falls to 62.5F to 81.5F.  The changes to the temperature range from June to December are indicators that the temperature would remain well for both surfing and ice cream year-round.
