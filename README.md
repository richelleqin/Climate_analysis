# Climate_analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. To do this, we want to find out the temperature trends using the temperature data for the month of June and December.
## Results
- Looking into interquartile range, we would see that in June the range of temperature is from 67F to 83F, whereas in December it falls to 62.5F to 81.5F.  The changes to the temperature range from June to December are indicators that the temperature would remain well for both surfing and ice cream year-round. 
- Looking into the standard deviation, we find that 95% of the temperature range in June falls between 68.4F and 81.5F. Whereas in December, 95% of the temperature range falls between 63.6F and 78.5F. The trend in the ranges once again shows that the surfing and ice cream business would thrive. 
- Looking into the 97.5% range for the data for June, the temperature ranges from 65.2F to 84.7F, and in December ranges from 59.8F to 82.3F. That means that the coldest days of where the shop would not be doing well only occurs on about 2.5% of December, with the coldest days under 59.8 degrees only occurring around 1.25% of December. This is a good indicator that the surf and ice cream shop would do well year-round.
## Summary
The ice cream shop is sustainable year-round because the temperature does not dramatically fluctuate over the year. In fact, the temperature is shown that ignoring outliers would range in considerable temperature with 97.5% of the days above 63.5F. Two additional queries are created based on the precipitation comparison between June and December and temperature measurement for each station. We can conclude that December has higher precipitation and USC00514830 has the highest temperature which means we might expect most sales generating from this station.
